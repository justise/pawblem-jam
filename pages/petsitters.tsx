                                Animals are my passion; I have a bucket list
                                full of animal-related activities, events &
                                goals. <br />
                                I grew up with dogs; Golden Retrievers, Old
                                English Sheepdogs, Shibas, Shih Tzus, mixed
                                breeds... <br />
                                I love dogs of all temperaments, shapes and
                                sizes! <br />
                                We raised Casper, an Umbrella Cockatoo, who had
                                the voice of an opera singer! <br />
                                When I was 14, I began cleaning horse stalls in
                                exchange for riding lessons.
                                <br />
                                I joined 4-H when I turned 15 and became highly
                                involved with that.
                                <br />
                                To help put myself through college, I got a job
                                at a veterinary hospital.
                                <br />
                                10 years ago, I adopted a ragdoll rescue kitty
                                that I named Gracie, who quickly became my best
                                friend.
                                <br />
                                Since losing Gracie, I adopted two more little
                                furballs; Kona & Riley, who make me smile every
                                day.
                                <br />I am currently training with my 14 month
                                old daughter, for a charity run for Old Dog

                                child, when his parents brought him home a
                                little Lhasa Apso he named Jester. Jester moved
                                to Kirkland from Alaska with him in April, 2000,
                                where they kept each other company during the
                                transition to a new city.

                                for the Seattle Pug Rescue, and is a part-time

                                truly enjoys his time working with the pets.
                                Jester sadly passed away a few years ago, so it
                                gives him the opportunity to still have animals
                                in his life. "There is nothing more rewarding

                                I am and always will be drawn to animals, I
                                couldn't imagine growing up, or living life
                                without my furry family additions. My family
                                consists of two dogs; Durango and Suzie, and
                                three cats; Jake, Trixie and Zilla. My animals
                                are my children and they are all spoiled rotten
                                but deservingly so. I owe them so much as they
                                recently help me get through a most difficult
                                and painful time in my life.

                                I have always worked in a corporate environment,

                                was never personally satisfying. Now I look
                                forward to each day caring for the needs of a
                                furry acquaintance. I have learned a lot from
                                being around animals but what our pets teach us
                                the most is to see with our heart and to love
                                without condition.

                                spending time with a calf because she was lonely
                                when I was not near her.

                                are out of town. I love being with them, and
                                getting to understand their personalities.

                                My name is Stevie and I'm 30 years old. I just
                                moved to the Redmond area about a year ago.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ever since I was a little girl I have had a
                                strong passion for animals. I was raised on a
                                small farm in Oregon. We had cows, a horse, a
                                few goats, dogs and cats...I was in heaven.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Now being able to work with animals is a dream
                                come true. I look forward to work every day.
                            </p>
