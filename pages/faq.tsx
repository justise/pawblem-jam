                                they show up? What if they don't have experience
                                working with animals? What happens if there's an
                                emergency? Most professional pet sitters are
                                licensed & and insured. This ensures everyone's
                                protection, including; the owners, the pets, and
                                the sitters, and means you can trust us to act
                                responsibly when we enter your home.

                                others, so to ensure the safety of your dog(s)

                                Pets are generally visited between the hours of
                                9:00am to 6:00pm and visits are divided into
                                morning, midday and evening time periods. The
                                actual time your pet is visited depends on a
                                variety of logistical situations such as
                                location, traffic, construction and proximity to
                                other pet sitting clients. We will try to get as
                                close to a time that you request but cannot
                                guarantee it.
